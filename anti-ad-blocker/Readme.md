# Anti-Ad Blocker Script

This script detects ad blockers on your website and shows a message encouraging users to disable it. The message is customizable and comes with a secondary, more light-hearted reminder.

## How to Use

Simply include the following script in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://samkarya.github.io/bcaexamprep/anti-ad-blocker/anti-ad-blocker.js"></script>
```

This setup will allow anyone to easily use your anti-ad-blocker script by adding the `<script>` tag to their webpage.

You should also include the required HTML and CSS for the message displays.

Example
Check the [check-if-script-works.html](check-if-script-works.html) for a working demo of how to integrate the script.

Customization
The ad blocker message can be styled using custom CSS (see styles.css for the default styles).
You can update the text and images used in the messages to match your website's theme.
